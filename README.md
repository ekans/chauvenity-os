# chauvenity-os

[![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/ekans/chauvenity-os/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekans/chauvenity-os/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Personal Fedora Atomic development workstation for Elixir/Erlang work at Airnity, built with [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/).

**Why "chauvenity"?** A French wordplay on my company name: Airnity → air ≈ hair → *chauve* (French for bald) + nity = chauvenity.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing Fedora Atomic installation:

1. Rebase to the unsigned image (to get signing keys installed):
   ```
   rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ekans/chauvenity-os:latest
   ```

2. Reboot:
   ```
   systemctl reboot
   ```

3. Rebase to the signed image:
   ```
   rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ekans/chauvenity-os:latest
   ```

4. Reboot again:
   ```
   systemctl reboot
   ```

The `latest` tag always points to the most recent build using the Fedora version specified in `recipes/recipe.yml`.

## Verification

Images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). Verify with:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/ekans/chauvenity-os
```
